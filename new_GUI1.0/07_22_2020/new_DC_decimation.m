function varargout = new_DC_decimation(varargin)
% NEW_DC_DECIMATION MATLAB code for new_DC_decimation.fig
%      NEW_DC_DECIMATION, by itself, creates a new NEW_DC_DECIMATION or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = NEW_DC_DECIMATION returns the handle to a new NEW_DC_DECIMATION or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      NEW_DC_DECIMATION('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in NEW_DC_DECIMATION.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      NEW_DC_DECIMATION('Property','Value',...) creates a new NEW_DC_DECIMATION or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before new_DC_decimation_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to new_DC_decimation_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
